Light Up the Couch
==================

Light Up the Couch is a project which offers a means to play the puzzle game
[Lights Out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_%28game%29 "Light Out on Wikipedia")
on a [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/ "The Apache CouchDB site").

CouchApp

This project uses the 
[CouchApp](http://couchapp.org/page/index "Documentation for CouchApp's")

>The CouchApp command line tool is used to generate code templates in your 
>application and to push your changes to an instance of couchdb, among other
>things.

We try to follow the git workflow as outlined by
